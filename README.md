# React homework template

This project was created with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). To get
acquainted and configure additional features
[refer to documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

## Preparing for coding

1. Make sure you have an LTS version of Node.js installed on your computer.
   [Download and install](https://nodejs.org/en/) if needed.
2. Install the project's base dependencies with the `npm install` command.
3. Start development mode by running the `npm start` command.
4. Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. This
   page will automatically reload after saving changes to the project files.

## Deploy

The production version of the project will automatically be linted, built, and
deployed to GitHub Pages, in the `gh-pages` branch, every time the `main` branch
is updated. For example, after a direct push or an accepted pull request. To do
this, you need to edit the `homepage` field in the `package.json` file,
replacing `your_username` and `your_repo_name` with your own, and submit the
changes to GitHub.

```json
"homepage": "https://your_username.github.io/your_repo_name/"
```

Next, you need to go to the settings of the GitHub repository (`Settings` >
`Pages`) and set the distribution of the production version of files from the
`/root` folder of the `gh-pages` branch, if this was not done automatically.

### Deployment status

The deployment status of the latest commit is displayed with an icon next to its
ID.

- **Yellow color** - the project is being built and deployed.
- **Green color** - deployment completed successfully.
- **Red color** - an error occurred during linting, build or deployment.

More detailed information about the status can be viewed by clicking on the
icon, and in the drop-down window, follow the link `Details`.

### Routing

If your application uses the `react-router-dom` library for routing, you must
additionally configure the `<BrowserRouter>` component by passing the exact name
of your repository in the `basename` prop. Slashes at the beginning and end of
the line are required.

```jsx
<BrowserRouter basename="/your_repo_name/">
  <App />
</BrowserRouter>
```
